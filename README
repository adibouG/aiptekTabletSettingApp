This weekend I retrieved an old old old graphic tablet, like 20 years old
still pluged the USB (1.0)
Ubuntu Mate recognized it .. almost correctly .. the  pen acting weirdly...

but ... Mostly some X server configuration to fix,

However after fixing the X server  configuration,
there is still no tablet settings to tune it,
and no other model seems to match enough to be tweaked
and have a  working tablet setting interface in the Mate GUI

As it not much missing to make it usable  I am starting it
I will add additional settings anf features as  they will be needed
.
